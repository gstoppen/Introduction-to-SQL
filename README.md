# Introduction-to-SQL

In todayâ€™s digital world, businesses and industries collect massive amounts of data every day and store it in databases. These enterprises must be able to not only collect and store data, but also analyze it to make strategic decisions and to solve real-life problems. One of the fundamental skills required for such data analysis is SQL. So, what is SQL?

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a simple programming language designed to manage and to interact with data stored in something called a database. A database enables you to efficiently retrieve the data you need, when you need it. Databases are ubiquitous in today's digital world, and SQL is your key to interacting with the valuable data that is stored inside them.

Learn everything you need to know to begin working with databases. You will learn about the syntax in SQL that is applicable to many types of relational database management systems (RDBMS), including Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle and Postgres.


## Who Should Enroll

This class is for everyone regardless of technical background. It is both for complete beginners or for anyone who has worked or interacted with data in a professional capacity.

This course will provide learners with the foundation necessary to utilize SQL in the workplace. It is also a valuable course for anyone looking for a career change into the database world.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this class, you will have learned how to:

Connect to a database
Retrieve the information from a database
Perform simple analysis such as filtering, grouping and ordering data
Export your data into different formats so you can use it for presentations etc.

## Prerequisites & Preparation

No prerequisite knowledge is required. It is highly recommended to take this class along with the [Introduction to Relational Database Design](https://informal.utexas.edu/classes/introduction-relational-database-design) and [Introduction to Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)](https://informal.utexas.edu/classes/introduction-relational-database-management-systems-rdbms) classes. In those two classes, you will not only learn how to design your own database, but you will also get a basic and general understanding of how databases work including how to administer and maintain a personal or enterprise-level database.
